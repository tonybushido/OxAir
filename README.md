# OxAir
This is the resposity for the OxAir community air quality action group. 

OxAir is a demonstrator project for air quality & sensor technologies. It aims to combine the best of the sensor & air quality communities to help assess day-to-day human health exposure to air pollution. Using sensors we are looking for high spatio-temporal resolutions to go a bit beyond what is generally available atthe moment. The evidence generated will support more robust air pollution reduction strategies which are urgently needed to reduce air pollution in the 'shortest time possible', as the lawyers might say. We hope to deliver broader benefits too, including better, more local information on real world pollution for informed decision making by individuals, in policy & strategies. 

## Why OxAir? 
The project partners all live & work in & around Oxford. Oxford also has a progressive, enlightened & environmentally conscious city, facing transport challenges. 

## Context
Air pollution is a widespread, modern-day environmental concern with well documented human health & economic impacts. UK Government & citizens alike have called for more to be done to tackle the air pollution problem and there is recognition that in order to be successful where other efforts have failed, we need to be enterprising, innovative & responsive to local conditions.

OxAir aims to respond to this challenge by demonstrating how sensors deployed on buses, bikes & pedestrians within the city can generate a new of high-resolution, low cost evidence base that will;

* Map real-world human exposures for typical, everyday Oxford life-styles.
* Better inform local policies on how to deliver emission reductions.
* Better inform the public to make choices relevant to them - to educate on how changes can be made to reduce air pollution & exposure to it.
*	Generate an evidence base to help measure & monitor the effectiveness of policies to improve air quality.
*	Engage with policy makers, the public & support science projects with schools & communities.

## Funding Status
In March 2019, OxAir was awarded grant funding by Oxford City Councilto support their work on local air quality management & explore co-benefits.

A very big thank you to the Oxford University Sustainable Transport team form our initial seedcorn funding which got us started. 

Currently, actively looking for funding via the traditional pathways; Defra, InnovateUK, SBRI, NIHR. If you think you can help us please contact us.
